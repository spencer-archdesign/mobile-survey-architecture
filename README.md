# Mobile Survey Architecture (In Progress)

This repository documents the architectural design of a mobile field survey system
intended to support offline-first data capture for compliance and operational workflows.

## Status
🚧 Design in progress — documentation reflects current thinking, not a finalized system.

## Goals
- Offline-first data capture
- Field-friendly UX
- Reliable sync and reconciliation
- Integration with a central operations platform

## Why This Repo Exists
This repository focuses on **design decisions and constraints**, not implementation.
